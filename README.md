The R package **dynsurv** provides functions fitting time-varying coefficient
models for interval censored and right censored survival data.

Three major approaches are implemented:

1. Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or dynamic
   coefficients for right censored and interval censored data;
1. Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data;
1. Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for right censored data
   using estimating equations.


## Installation

You may install the released version from [CRAN][cran-url].
